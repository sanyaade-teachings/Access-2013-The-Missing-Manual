When you first open some of the more complex databases in later chapters, you might not see all the database objects in the navigation pane at first. Some groups might be collapsed to draw your attention to specific objects that are important for the given example. Read Chapter 14 for complete information about how the navigation pane works, and how to show or hide just what you want.

There are no examples for chapters 19-23, because these chapters deal with ways to take your existing databases and deploy them or convert them (for example, on a network, in a SQL Server database, on the Web, and so on). You can use the databases from earlier chapters to try out these features. The files in the Chapter05 directory provide a good starting point, because they include simple databases with table relationships but no reports, forms, or code.
